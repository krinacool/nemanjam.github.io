## Overview

Chrome/Firefox extension for easier tracking of new comments on Reddit.

## Goals

Get practical experience in building browser extensions. Work with low level browser API's.

## Tech stack

- Browser extension, React, Typescript, IndexedDB
- RadixUI, React Hook Form, TailwindCSS

## Features

- Highlight unread comments by visit and by time.
- State between popup UI and Reddit DOM is synced in realtime.
- Limit IndexedDB size by deleting oldest entries.

## Implementation details

The app heavily relies on proper event handling, first of all debounced `onScroll`, but also `onLoad` and `visibilitychange` events. For all DOM manipulations it uses native `document.querySelectorAll()` without any declarative framework. Reddit uses shadow DOM which is an additional challenge for querying. I used closures to store state to save performance in loops for traversing nodes.

The popup UI is built with RadixUI components and React Hook Form. Tailwind preflight styles are disabled to prevent interfering with Reddit styles. I implemented a messaging system for communication between the popup and the content script. 

All state is persisted in IndexedDB database that is limited to 1MB usage. Firefox build uses manifest v2 and Chrome manifest v3.

## Lessons learned 

- People often do not have a habit to use browser extensions, it is challenging to get users.
- A solid and up-to-date extension boilerplate project might not be available and it is crucial for success.
- It can be challenging to support both v2 and v3 manifests.
- A proper retry base functionality is required for a reliable DOM traversing.
- Websites often update DOM, keeping extension up-to-date requires time and energy.
- IndexedDB has non-ergonomic API, use wrapper library instead.
