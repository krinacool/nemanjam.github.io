## Overview

Job ads aggregator for the HackerNews "Who’s Hiring" threads with focus on fresh and recurring job opportunities.

## Goals

Evaluate the potential of the idea and the level of interest for a website of this type. Build MVP quickly.

## Tech stack

- Next.js, ShadcnUI, TailwindCSS
- SQLite, better-sqlite3
- Keyv, Keyv LRU, node-cron, Docker

## Features

- Group companies into 3 categories: 1. First time, 2. New, 3. Old
- Visualize data with graphs 
- Link and sort ads chronologically
- Search company posting history
- Automate parsing with cron jobs
- Improve performance with caching and server side rendering
- Deploy with Docker

## Implementation details

## Lessons learned 

- Idea and project got most attention on HackerNews because the public is already profiled and familiar with "Who’s Hiring" threads.
- HackerNews is very strict with scraping their pages, best to use alternative data sources.
- Keyv cache instance is available only within the original Next.js app process, and `cache.clear()` call from the cron script that runs in a separate Node.js process does not have any effect. Solved by detecting database change and clearing cache in the original Next.js app. Cache that runs as a standalone process like Redis would also work.
- It is not possible to run cron in Docker as non-root user, so it is best to use Node.js or Go package for scheduling tasks inside Docker.
