## Overview

React Native chat app.

## Goals

Learn React Native by building a basic chat app with users and groups.

## Tech stack

- React Native, Apollo GraphQL, NativeBase
- Sequelize, PostgreSQL

## Features

- Auth, profile
- Users with friends relations, public and private groups
- Real time updates with refetching and subscriptions

## Implementation details

At the time React Native and GraphQL were very popular combination for efficient data fetching. The app uses Apollo for CRUD operations and real time subscriptions. React Navigation is used for routing between activity screens. The UI is built using NativeBase components.

The most challenging part is the PostgreSQL database schema that supports relations between User, Group, Chat and Message models. Database is managed via Sequelize ORM.
