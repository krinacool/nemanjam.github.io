## Introduction

Most of the consumer grade internet connections are hidden behind the CG-NAT and not reachable from the internet. This is done in order to save IP addresses because IPv4 has limited range. If you have a static public IPv4 or (any) IPv6 address you wont need the setup from this tutorial.

There are already services like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://github.com/ngrok) for this purpose but when you actually start using them you will often find out that they have some limitations on a free plan. So, we will configure our custom setup once and will have it always available for comfortable and practical usage that will save a lot of time and nerves in the long run.

## Why is this useful

This is useful whenever you need to share your local project with others or provide a publicly accessible URL for your service so that external systems can reach it. This is often the case if you work remotely.

Yes, you can use test deployments, but having a tunnel setup configured and being able to do it with a single terminal command saves a lot of time and energy.

Possible use cases:

- Sharing work in progress with clients or teammates
- Remote debugging or pair programming
- Demos for presentations or team meetings
- Testing the frontend on different devices (mobile, different resolution, OS, browser)
- Testing webhooks from external services (Stripe, GitHub, Oauth, Slack, Contentful, Twilio, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- A VPS server with a public IP and Docker
- A local machine with a working SSH and dev server that you want to expose 
- A domain name (optional)

## Architecture overview

Without going too deep into the theory of computer networks lets explain a port forwarding in simplified terms. Port forwarding is a mapping (binding) between two points (services) on a private network (or on the same machine) that would otherwise be unreachable. You can think of it as a VPN for a single service (port).

So it's exactly what we need: we want to bind (redirect traffic from) a public port (1081 in our case) on the VPS that acts as a gateway to port 3000 on our local dev server that is not directly reachable from the internet. That's it for the tunneling part, this setup is sufficient for serving HTTP traffic.

Additionally, to support HTTPS and a user-friendly URL, we will add Traefik, which will handle HTTPS certificates and route traffic from port 443 to port 1081 of the tunnel.

## Running the SSH server in Docker

We already use SSH to access our VPS, but we prefer to keep that configuration untouched. So, we will run a separate SSH server inside a Docker container specifically for tunneling. 

For this, we will use [linuxserver/openssh-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openssh-server) image. [Linuxserver](https://github.com/linuxserver) is an organization that maintains very stable Dokcer images for all kinds of purposes. 

By default SSH server doesn't allow tunneling so we need to modify config in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and enable it.

```bash title="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes
```

```bash 
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# edit config...

sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

But actually, since we are using a Docker container we will do it in a different way.

We will use [openssh-server-ssh-tunnel](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/openssh-server-ssh-tunnel) mod, which enables tunnelling in the `linuxserver/openssh-server` image. You can think of mods as presets (additional layers and configurations) for their images.


Here is `docker-compose.yml` for the SSH tunnel container:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml" 
version: '3.8'

services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    container_name: openssh-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: openssh-server #optional
    expose:
      - 1081 # tunneled service port, for Traefik
    ports:
      - 1080:2222 # 1080 is the main SSH connection port
    environment:
      # https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - SHELL_NOLOGIN=false
      # set correct for current host user
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      # important
      - PUBLIC_KEY 
      # optional env vars bellow
      - SUDO_ACCESS=true 
      - USER_NAME=username 
      - PASSWORD_ACCESS=false 
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    # Traefik configuration bellow
    labels:
      - 'traefik.enable=true'
      - 'traefik.docker.network=proxy'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.rule=Host(`preview.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.service=ssh-tunnel'
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel.loadbalancer.server.port=1081' # matches exposed port
    networks:
      - proxy

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

Lets explain the code above:


```yml
services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    # ...
    ports:
      - 1080:2222 # 1080 is the main SSH connection port
```

By default `linuxserver/docker-openssh-server` runs SSH service on port `2222`, that is done so it doesn't conflict with the usual port `22` that is used for hosts SSH service and it's hardcoded in [Dockerfile](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openssh-server/blob/76dd1c4a0101a694ec848c1e975c9e33a7945d0a/Dockerfile#L39). We will choose **port `1080` to run the main SSH connection**, so we need to map it to port `2222` with SSH in the container. Port `1080` is used for an actual connection over the internet and **it is required to allow that port in VPS firewall.**

So, let's establish a precise and clear naming from the beginning:

- port `1080` - the main SSH connection port
- ports `1081, 1082, 1083, ...` - tunneled services remote ports

Additionally, you need to configure SSH client on your dev machine to use `1080` for SSH to connect to this container as well. In this example I named VPS host `amd1` and SSH container host `amd1c`, you can use your own naming logic.

```bash title="~/.ssh/config"

# ssh amd1 ssh container
Host amd1c 123.123.123.123 # VPS IP
    HostName 123.123.123.123
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-keys/amd1_ssh_container__id_ed25519 # private key file name
    User username
    Port 1080
```

In the client SSH config above you notice the private key file `amd1_ssh_container__id_ed25519`. The public key is passed to the SSH container as environment variable:

```yml
services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    # ...
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_KEY # important
```

You generate SSH key pars as usual, e.g.:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "myemail@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/my-keys/amd1_ssh_container__id_ed25519
```

Now we choose on which remote port we will expose our local dev server. If you use Traefik and don't access this port directly via browser you don't need to allow it in VPS's firewall.

```yml
services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    # ...
    expose:
      - 1081 # tunneled service remote port
```

The other environment variables worth mentioning are the following:

```yml
services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    # ...
    environment:
      # https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
```

We use `DOCKER_MODS` variable to specify `openssh-server-ssh-tunnel` mod. `PUID` and `PGID` are user and group ids for handling permissions between the host and the container. You get their values by running `id -u && id -g` on the VPS host. It is also a good idea to export them as global environment variables in `~/.bashrc` file to make them available for all containers:

```bash title="~/.bashrc"
export MY_UID=$(id -u)
export MY_GID=$(id -g)
```
Then you can pass them like this:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
  # ...
  environment:
    - PUID=$MY_UID
    - PGID=$MY_GID
```

SSH tunnel is now configured, now you can access your local dev server by HTTP via the your VPS IP e.g. `http://123.123.123.123:1081` or domain `http://my-domain.com:1081`.

## Configuring HTTPS with Traefik

Some browsers disallow insecure HTTP traffic by default and you need to tweak the browser settings to allow it explicitly. This can be inconvenient when you are sending a demo link to non-technical person, also some OAuth providers require HTTPS even for testing (e.g. Facebook). So lets make an additional effort to do things properly and configure a HTTPS with subdomain using Traefik.

If you are running a VPS chances are you already use some reverse proxy for handling certificates and subdomain routing. This example shows how to do it with Traefik.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml" 

services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    container_name: openssh-server
    # ...
    expose:
      - 1081 # tunneled service remote port
    ports:
      - 1080:2222 # 1080 is the main SSH connection port

    # Traefik configuration bellow
    labels:
      - 'traefik.enable=true'
      - 'traefik.docker.network=proxy'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.rule=Host(`preview.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.service=ssh-tunnel'
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel.loadbalancer.server.port=1081' # matches exposed port
    networks:
      - proxy

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

The truth is, there is not much work to do here, all you need to do is to map the remote port of the tunnel `1081` to Traefik. Also define the URL on which you want to expose your local dev server via the environment variable e.g. `SITE_HOSTNAME=preview.my-domain.com`.

Everything else is just generic Traefik configuration. Also don't forget to add the wildcard A record for your subdomains (e.g. maybe add `*.tunnels` "namespace") in your DNS provider's dashboard and point to your VPS IP. And also to create an external Docker network, e.g. named `proxy` in the example above.

```yml 
services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    container_name: openssh-server
    # ...
    expose:
      - 1081 # tunneled service remote port, passed to Traefik

    # ...
    # Traefik configuration bellow
    labels:
      # ...
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel.rule=Host(`preview.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)' # in .env file: SITE_HOSTNAME=my-domain.com
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel.loadbalancer.server.port=1081' # matches the exposed port
```

In the end you just need to define a 2 environment variables for your `docker-compose.yml` inside the `.env` file:

```bash title=".env"
# full with subdomain, without 'https://'
SITE_HOSTNAME=my-domain.com # or e.g. preview.my-domain.com

# public ssh key
PUBLIC_KEY=my-public-ssh-key
```

Above is shown just the relevant Traefik configuration for SSH tunnel container. A complete Traefik reverse proxy configuration requires additional static and dynamic configuration for the Traefik container, but that is out of the scope of this tutorial. You can search the examples of Traefik configuration or reuse mine that is available in this repository [nemanjam/traefik-proxy](https://github.com/nemanjam/traefik-proxy).

## Tunneling multiple services

Sometimes your app runs more than a single service, e.g. frontend and backend. If you expose just a frontend from port 3000 note that `localhost` from e.g. `localhost:5000` wont be resolved, so you need to tunnel all services and set tunneled URLs in your `.env` files.

How to have more than a single tunnel? Maybe your first thought is to run multiple SSH server containers, but fortunately that is not needed, you can tunnel as many services you want through a single SSH connection. You just need to expose multiple ports on SSH container and map them to multiple Traefik hosts with labels, like shown bellow:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml" 
version: '3.8'

services:
  openssh-server:
    image: linuxserver/openssh-server
    container_name: openssh-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: openssh-server #optional
    # tunneled services, remote ports
    expose:
      - 1081 # tunnel1
      - 1082 # tunnel2
      - 1083 # tunnel3
    ports:
      - 1080:2222 # 1080 is the main SSH connection port
    environment:
      # https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:openssh-server-ssh-tunnel
      - SHELL_NOLOGIN=false
      # set correct for current host user
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      # important
      - PUBLIC_KEY 
      # optional env vars bellow
      - SUDO_ACCESS=true 
      - USER_NAME=username 
      - PASSWORD_ACCESS=false 
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    # Traefik configuration bellow
    labels:
      # common config
      - 'traefik.enable=true'
      - 'traefik.docker.network=proxy'

      # tunnel1 (port 3000 -> 1081)
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel1.rule=Host(`preview1.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel1.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel1.service=ssh-tunnel1'
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel1.loadbalancer.server.port=1081'

      # tunnel2 (port 5000 -> 1082)
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel2.rule=Host(`preview2.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel2.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel2.service=ssh-tunnel2'
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel2.loadbalancer.server.port=1082'

      # tunnel3 (port 5001 -> 1083)
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel3.rule=Host(`preview3.${SITE_HOSTNAME}`)'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel3.entrypoints=websecure'
      - 'traefik.http.routers.ssh-tunnel3.service=ssh-tunnel3'
      - 'traefik.http.services.ssh-tunnel3.loadbalancer.server.port=1083'

    networks:
      - proxy

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

If you have a really big number of services to tunnel you might want to use a VPN to access all ports by default, but thats rarely the case.

Another point to make is that SSH tunnel technique is most suitable for temporary exposing services for demo purposes. For permanent tunnels you would need to add `autossh` to keep connection alive, but there are a better tools for permanent tunnels, like [rapiz1/rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole) or [fatedier/frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp).

## Open firewall on VPS

For the main SSH connection you will need to open a port in your VPS firewall, port `1080` in this example. Additionally, if you want to access tunnels directly via port in the browser without Traefik, you will need to open those ports too. Be mindful not to open to many unneeded ports as every new opened port increases the attack surface.

<Image {...IMAGE_SIZES.FIXED.MDX_MD} src={FirewallImage} alt="Example opened ports in the firewall" />

## Running the tunnel

You start the tunnel with a single command like bellow. `-R` option means remote port forwarding, then you have two `IP:port` pairs, the first pair is remote, the second is local. At the end you have the VPS host.

```bash
# command format
ssh -R [remote_addr:]remote_port:local_addr:local_port [user@]gateway_addr

# example:
# amd1c host is defined in ~/.ssh/config
ssh -R *:1081:localhost:3000 amd1c

# access the url, e.g.
https://preview1.my-domain.com

# terminate tunnel, like any ssh connection
exit
```
You can open the multiple tunnels with a single command, just specify the tunnels one after another before the host. Note that you must have these tunnels defined in your `docker-compose.yml` of SSH server (exposed ports and Traefik host labels).

```bash
# tunnel frontend at port 3000 and backend at port 5000
ssh \
  -R *:1081:localhost:3000 \
  -R *:1082:localhost:5000 \
  amd1c

# access the urls, e.g.
https://preview1.my-domain.com
https://preview2.my-domain.com/api
```

## Conclusion

Port forwarding is a basic networking technique very familiar to network engineers, but maybe not often enough utilized by developers. And it can be very useful and practical, especially in a remote work setting. Like described in this tutorial, you just need to run a single container, configure the client and firewall, but once you have it it can save you a lot of time and energy in a long run.

SSH remote port forwarding is just one of the many useful and cool SSH networking tricks, there are many others like dynamic port forwarding, SSH agent forwarding, X11 forwarding, SSH file system, etc., do you use some of them? Please share in the comments bellow.
